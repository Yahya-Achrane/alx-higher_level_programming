The basic data structures in Python are:

Lists: Lists are ordered sequences of elements. They are mutable, which means that they can be changed after they are created. Lists are created using square brackets [].
Tuples: Tuples are ordered sequences of elements, similar to lists. However, tuples are immutable, which means that they cannot be changed after they are created. Tuples are created using parentheses ().
Sets: Sets are unordered collections of unique elements. This means that no element can appear in a set more than once. Sets are created using curly braces {}.
Dictionaries: Dictionaries are key-value mappings. This means that each element in a dictionary has a key and a value. The key is used to access the value. Dictionaries are created using curly braces {}.
